## Simple flashlight

### Background

The prototype of the flashlight design was lying around for a long time. In a joined effort we improved and prepared it to use it in a workshop at re:publica 2022. In this workshop, we want to give insights into our approach to Critical Making and let you experience it first hand. While we build a small flashlight together, we explain the concepts of Critical Making and highlight some starting point to make projects, workshops or lessons more critical.

**What's Critical Making?**

Well, that's a good question! We will add more info here at a later stage.
